While the temperature of the habitat influences how often a certain color appears, all colors can be found all over the world. 6 tentacles of different sizes, based on which ocean or sea they come from. They are in the same family as jellyfishes, however their sizes differ significantly. </p>

                            How did we not find Biolumi earlier?

                            It is impressive that Biolumi can be as big as a ship and yet we have only discovered them recently. As fascinating as this is, it is completely expected. Biolumi is one of many creatures of the deep see which we have barely explored. In fact we suspect that the many tales of the Kraken come from this creature. Even though Biolumi was only recently discovered and recorded, it might have been around for many centuries before us.
