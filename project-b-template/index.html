      <div class = "content_Style_right"> The internet stands as the most impactful invention of our era, reshaping our everyday routines in unprecedented ways. Prior to its existence, obtaining basic information, for example the capital of Nebraska required a trip to the library to sift through geography books—a stark contrast to the instant access we now enjoy with a simple browser search (it’s Lincoln btw). Can you fathom writing a research paper devoid of the ability to filter through targeted information and having to read tens of books to find the specific information which supports your thesis?

      <div class = "content_Style_left"> Every coin has its flip side, and the internet is no exception. It serves as a captivating vessel for connectivity and creativity, enriching our lives with convenience and intrigue. Yet, lurking within its depths lies the darker side of the web, inhabited by hackers, scammers, viruses, thieves, and trolls. Even the most vigilant internet users can succumb to these threats. Another concern with the internet is the permanence of public information. A seemingly innocent post made during adolescence can resurface years later, potentially impacting professional opportunities such as job interviews. How does one navigate explaining a controversial Arabian night party costume from 2001 while simultaneously being the Prime Minister of Canada?
